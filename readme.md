🏠 Interactive Room Portfolio

An immersive 3D personal portfolio built with Three.js. This virtual room showcases my skills in web-based 3D rendering, interactive environments, and modular asset loading — all directly in the browser.

📌 Features

📂 Modular asset loader — dynamically load .glb or .glTF files.

🎮 Interactive objects — click on items to trigger minigames or view content.

🎥 Smooth camera controls — custom orbital focus and smooth transitions.

✨ Post-processing — outline highlights, bloom, and other effects.

⚙️ WebGL optimized — runs efficiently on modern browsers.

🚀 Demo
